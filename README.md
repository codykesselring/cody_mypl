To run programs on the myPL interpreter, type 'python mypl.py [path/file_name]' into the command line, which will run the program; console outputs will be displayed in the terminal.

There are test programs in the directory that display the capabilities of classes, these are named 'test_[rest].mypl' for example: 'python mypl.py test_class_bst.mypl' will execute the file test_class_bst.mypl and output Tree Values: 1 2 5 7 10 12 13 14 15 Tree Height: 5 into the terminal

For my myPL addition I chose classes, which are syntactically defined like this:

which is similar to the initialization and definition of structs, except with associated methods within the definition that can be called elsewhere.
